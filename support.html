            <h1>Emotional support</h1>
            <p>If you have experienced online abuse, harassment, or other forms of digital harm, it’s important to take steps to protect yourself and seek support.</p>
            <p>Experiencing digital harm can cause a range of emotions like fear, confusion, anger, or sadness. These feelings are valid and real. Seeking support is important. You are not alone—help is available.</p>
         
            <h2>First steps</h2>
            <h3>Dealing with Abuse or Harassment</h3>
            <p>• <b>Mute</b> the offender: This will prevent their posts from appearing in your feed without letting them know you’ve done so.</p>
            <p>• <b>Block</b> the offender: This will prevent them from contacting you, seeing your profile, or interacting with your posts. This can immediately reduce the emotional toll of seeing harmful messages and gives you space to process the situation.</p>
            <p>• <b>Report the abuse:</b> Most platforms have built-in reporting tools to help address online harassment. Reporting not only helps stop the behaviour but also signals to platforms that abusive content needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p> — Find out how to report harmful content on common social media, games, apps and sites <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/esafety-guide">here.</a></p>
            <p>• <b>Document the abuse:</b> It’s important to keep a record of the abuse in case you need to report it or pursue legal options. Take screenshots of messages, comments, or posts, and document the time, date, and platform where the abuse occurred. Having this evidence can help platform moderators or authorities take action.</p>
            <h3>Account security</h3>
            <p>• <b>Review Privacy Settings:</b> Go through your privacy settings on social media and other online platforms. Limit the visibility of your profile, personal information, and posts to only trusted friends or networks. Ensure that sensitive information, like your email address, location or phone number, are not publicly visible.</p>
            <p>• <b>Update Passwords:</b> If you suspect that your account may be at risk, update your passwords immediately. Choose strong, unique passwords that aren’t easy to guess, and avoid reusing passwords from other accounts.</p>
            <p>• <b>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</b> Adding an extra layer of security by enabling 2FA can prevent others from accessing your account, even if they have your password.</p>

            <h2>Coping strategies</h2>
            <p>• <b>Take a Break from Digital Spaces:</b> Stepping away from the platform or your device can provide emotional distance. Disconnecting allows you to refocus and regain control.</p>
            <p>• <b>Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises:</b> Practicing mindfulness or engaging in simple breathing exercises can help regulate emotions. Try focusing on your breath or using a guided meditation app to bring yourself back to the present moment and reduce feelings of panic or anxiety.</p>
            <p> — The <a href="https://hminnovations.org/meditation-app">Healthy Minds app</a> is a free and easy-to-use meditation app.</p>
            <p>• <b>Write Down Your Experiences:</b> Journaling your thoughts and feelings can help you process the situation and provide clarity on how the experience affected you.</p>
            <p> — The <a href="https://howwefeel.org/">How We Feel app</a> is a free journalling app for tracking your wellbeing and practicing coping strategies.</p>
            <p>• <b>Talk to Someone You Trust:</b> Sharing your experience with a friend, family member, or support group can offer emotional relief and validation.</p>

            <h2>Support Networks and Resources</h2>
            <h3>Counselling and Mental Health</h3>

            <h3>Legal Advice and Support</h3>
            <p>• If the digital harm involves doxxing (the sharing of your personal information) or severe threats, you may want to reach out to legal services to gain advice. Your local <a href="https://clcs.org.au/legal-help/">Community Legal Centre</a> or <a href="https://www.nationallegalaid.org/for-individuals/">Legal Aid</a> may be able to provide free and confidential advice.</p>
            <p>• The <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/">eSafety Commissioner</a> website can help Australians experiencing online bullying or abuse to take action or make a complaint.</p>

            <h2>Protect yourself moving forward</h2>
            <p>• If the scam involved the sharing of your personal details, change your passwords immediately to secure your online accounts.</p>
            <p>• Continue to monitor your financial accounts closely for any suspicious activity and report anything unusual to your bank immediately.</p>
            <p>• Scammers may attempt to target you again. Look out for new scams, especially if you do not know the person and you didn’t contact them first.</p>

            <h2>Get support</h2>
            <p>• If being scammed has caused you to become overwhelmed with debt, contact a <a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/managing-debt/financial-counselling">financial counsellor</a> as soon as possible. The earlier you get help, the better your options will be. This is a free and confidential service to help you get your debt under control.</p>
