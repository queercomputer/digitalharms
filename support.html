            <h1>Emotional support</h1>
            <p>If you have experienced online abuse, harassment, or other forms of digital harm, it’s important to take steps to protect yourself and seek support.</p>
            <p>Experiencing digital harm can cause a range of emotions like fear, confusion, anger, or sadness. These feelings are valid and real. Seeking support is important. You are not alone—help is available.</p>
         
            <h2>1. Immediate safety tips</h2>
            <h3>Dealing with Abuse or Harassment</h3>
            <p>• <b>Muting</b> the offender will prevent their messages or notifications from appearing in your feed without letting them know you’ve done so. </p>
            <p>• <b>Blocking</b> goes a step further by preventing them from contacting you, seeing your profile, or interacting with your posts. This can immediately reduce the emotional toll of seeing harmful messages and gives you space to process the situation.</p>
            <p>• <b>Report the abuse</b> on the platform where it occurred. Most platforms have built-in reporting tools to help address online harassment. Use these tools to report abusive content, whether it’s messages, posts, or comments. Reporting not only helps stop the behaviour but also signals to platforms that abusive content needs to be addressed. Make sure to document the abuse by taking screenshots or saving evidence. This can be useful if you need to escalate the issue to higher authorities or seek legal action.</p>
            <p>• It's important to keep a record of the abuse in case you need to report it later or pursue legal options. Take screenshots of abusive messages, comments, or posts, and save them in a safe place. Document the time, date, and platform where the abuse occurred. Having this evidence can help platform moderators or authorities take action.</p>
            <h3>Account security</h3>
            <p>• <b>Review Privacy Settings:</b> Go through your privacy settings on social media and other online platforms. Limit the visibility of your profile, personal information, and posts to only trusted friends or networks. Consider disabling location-sharing and ensuring that sensitive information like your email address or phone number is not publicly visible.</p>
            <p>• <b>Update Passwords:</b> If you’re experiencing digital harm, especially if you suspect that your account may be at risk, update your passwords immediately. Choose strong, unique passwords that aren’t easy to guess, and avoid reusing passwords from other accounts.</p>
            <p>• <b>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</b> Adding an extra layer of security by enabling 2FA can prevent others from accessing your account, even if they have your password. This can significantly reduce the chances of further harm, like account hacking or identity theft.</p>

            <h2>2. Emotional coping strategies</h2>
            <h3>Grounding Techniques</h3>
            <p>• <b>Be Kind to Yourself:</b> Experiencing digital harm can make you feel vulnerable or attacked, but it’s important to remember that these incidents do not define who you are. Focus on practicing self-compassion—remind yourself that your worth isn’t tied to the negative actions of others. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, or taking time for self-care.</p>
            <p>• <b>Take a Break from Digital Spaces:</b> When digital harm occurs, stepping away from the platform can provide much-needed emotional distance. Disconnecting, even briefly, allows you to refocus and regain control over your emotional state. A break can prevent feelings of being overwhelmed by negativity.</p>
            <p>• <b>Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises:</b> Practicing mindfulness or engaging in simple breathing exercises can help regulate emotions in the immediate aftermath of an upsetting online interaction. Try focusing on your breath or using a guided meditation app to bring yourself back to the present moment and reduce feelings of panic or anxiety.</p>
            <h3>Processing Emotions</h3>
            <p>• <b>Write Down Your Experiences:</b> Journaling your thoughts and feelings can help you process the situation and provide clarity on how the experience affected you. Writing can also be a way to vent frustration, anger, or sadness in a safe space without fear of judgment.</p>
            <p>• <b>Talk to Someone You Trust:</b> Sharing your experience with a friend, family member, or support group can offer emotional relief and validation. Sometimes, just having someone listen to what you’ve gone through can help you feel less isolated in your experience.</p>

            <h2>4. Protect yourself moving forward</h2>
            <p>• If the scam involved the sharing of your personal details, change your passwords immediately to secure your online accounts.</p>
            <p>• Continue to monitor your financial accounts closely for any suspicious activity and report anything unusual to your bank immediately.</p>
            <p>• Scammers may attempt to target you again. Look out for new scams, especially if you do not know the person and you didn’t contact them first.</p>
