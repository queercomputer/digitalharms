            <h1>Scam support</h1>
            <p>If you have lost money or shared your personal details with a scammer, taking immediate action is crucial to limit the damage and protect yourself from further loss.</p>

            <h2>1. Contact your financial institution</h2>
            <p>• If you have made a payment or have shared your card details, inform your bank or card provider immediately. Ask them to stop any transactions or to cancel your card.</p>
            <p>• If you're unsure whether you're being scammed, <b>stop sending money right away</b> and contact IDCARE for tailored advice.

            <p>• Continue to monitor your financial accounts closely for any suspicious activity and report anything unusual to your bank immediately.</p>
