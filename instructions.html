              <a class="question" href="#">I'm a new participant. What do I need to do?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>There are three things for you to do:</p>
                <p>1. Fill out the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2J7WJ32">consent form</a> which we need to start you off. This should take about 2-3 minutes. You can access the consent form by clicking <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2J7WJ32">here.</a></p>
                <p>2. Check out the study instructions below.</p>
                <p>3. Each time you experience or witness an instance of digital harm, open the Digital Harms app and report the it to us.</p>
                <p>Thanks so much for joining this study, we really hope your participation will help us to understand and reduce digital hostility.</p>
              </div>

              <a class="question" href="#">How do I install the app?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>To make it easy for you, we have an app that you can install. This app will give you an easy to use button on your phone to press every time you receive a scam call or message. The app is very secure, and it will <i>never</i> take any data from your phone that you don’t enter into the app.</p>
                <p>To download and install, follow these steps:</p>
                <p>• On your smartphone go to <a href="https://www.digitalharmsproject.com.au/">https://www.digitalharmsproject.com.au/</a></p>
                <p>• Click the install button (top of the page, orange bar) for instructions.</p>
                <p> - For <b>ANDROID</b> phones, look for the “More” menu. This is the “three dots” menu in Chrome but could be different depending on your browser. Next, select “Add to Home Screen,” and then follow the prompts.</p> 
                <p> - For <b>APPLE / iOS</b> phones, look for the share button in Safari, select “Add to Home Screen,” and then follow the prompts.</p> 
                <p>If for any reason you cannot install the app, please simply visit the link above to inform us of any instances of digital harm you experience or witness.</p>
              </div>

              <a class="question" href="#">How do I notify the study when I experience or witness an instance of digital harm?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Each time you experience or witness something online you think may be a digital harm, we would like you to fill out a few short details by opening the app or clicking on the secure link we have sent to you as a text/SMS.</p>
                <p>The interface asks a few brief questions, and should take no more than two minutes to complete.</p>
                
                <h3>First step</h3>
                <p><b>Press the big red button that says "+ Report an instance of digital harm".</b> This will open the reporting interface.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/howto1.jpg">
                <p><b>Please enter your unique identifier we have sent you by SMS.</b> This helps us to match your experiences with the survey data you’ve already provided, so we can better map where and when people are targeted.</p>
                <p><b>Please also enter your initials.</b> This is so we can error-check against any typo in the unique identifier and to help you with any technical issues that may arise.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/howto2.jpg">
                <p><b>What did you experience or witness?</b> Finally, we ask what kind of digital harm you would like to report?</p>   
                <p><i>If you remember, it’s helpful to let us know at the end of each day if you haven’t experienced or witnessed digital harm, that way we can better track the days when people are most targeted. Hit “No I am letting you know I didn't experience or witness any digital harms today” and that will end the questions for the day.</i></p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/howto3.jpg">

                <h3>Second step</h3>
                <p>Here, we ask what platform or app the digital harm occured on.</p>
                <p>If you can't find the platform/app on the list provided, select "Other" and specify the platform.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/howto4.jpg">
                <p>Secondly, we will ask you a few questions about the nature of the digital harm:</p>
                <p> - how certain are you that this was abuse, harassment or hate speech.</p>
                <p> - do you know the person or persons who perpetrated the harm.</p>  
                <p> - the type of abuse or harassment that occured.</p>   
                <p> - how you'd describe the abuse.</p>   

               <h3>Third step</h3>
                <p>Please take a screenshot of the abusive content and upload it here. See the question below for how to do that on Android or iOS phones. The process is very simple.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, if you do not wish to upload a screenshot, you can provide some details about what the harm was about in the box at the bottom of the page. </p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/howto5.jpg">

                <h3>Fourth step</h3>
                <p>We will ask a few very quick questions about reporting and attitudes:</p>
                <p> —	Have you reported or do you plan to report the harm?</p>
                <p> —	Who did you report to? Or why did you choose not to report?</p>
                <p> —	How did the digital harm make you feel?</p>
                <p> —	Do you believe the harm should be taken off the platform?</p>

                <h3>Fifth step</h3>
                <p>Finally, we will ask if there is anything else you'd like to tell us about the incident.</p>
                <p><i>This question is optional, but if you feel like you have more to say about the harmful content, this is a great place to say it.</i></p>

              <a class="question" href="#">How do I take and upload a screenshot on an iPhone?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Each time you experience or witness soemthing online you believe may be harmful, we would like you to upload a screenshot of this content and any responses you give.</p>
                <h3>How to take a screenshot on an iPhone with Face ID?</h3>
                <p>1. Press the Side button and the Volume up button at the same time.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/iphone-x-and-later-take-screenshot.png">
                <p>2. Quickly release both buttons.</p>
                <p>3.	The screenshot will automatically be saved into your phone’s Photo Library.</p>
                <h3>How to take a screenshot on an iPhone with Touch ID?</h3>
                <p>1. Press the Side button and the Home button at the same time.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/iphone-home-button-take-screenshot.png">
                <p>2. Quickly release both buttons.</p>
                <p>3.	The screenshot will automatically be saved into your phone’s Photo Library.</p>
                <h3>How do I upload the screenshot to the study?</h3>
                <p>1. When you get to Question 8 in the questionnaire, please press the green bar “Choose File”.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/asset12.png">
                <p>2. Select “Photo Library”. This will take you to the most recent photos in your Photo Library.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/asset13.png">
                <p>3. Select the screenshot of the scam message. It will upload automatically. Continue to the end of questionnaire.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/asset14.png">
                <h3>Alternative step</h3>
                <p>If you are having trouble adding a screenshot – or you prefer not to add one – please use the next box (Question 9) to describe the scam communication. If you can cut-and-paste the message and add the phone number (if any) that would be very helpful.</p>
                <p>Any information will help the study, and that will help us develop ways to reduce scam targeting in Australia.</p>

              <a class="question" href="#">How do I take and upload a screenshot on an Android phone?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Each time you receive a message you think may be a scam, we would like you to upload a screenshot of the scam message and any responses you give. This may be a text message (SMS), a platform message (e.g., Facebook Messenger) or a platform post that appears on a social media feed.</p>
                <h3>How do I take a screenshot?</h3>
                <p>1. Press the Power and Volume down buttons at the same time.</p>
                <p>2. If that doesn't work, press and hold the Power button for a few seconds. Then tap Screenshot.</p>
                <p>If neither of these work, go to your <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/3094742?sjid=2705655391531367505-AP">phone manufacturer's support site</a> for help.</p>
                <h3>How do I upload the screenshot to the study?</h3>
                <p>1. When you get to the part of the questionnaire that asks about a screenshot, please press the green bar “Choose File”.</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/asset15.png">
                <p>2. Select the option for "Media picture".</p>
                <img class="instructions" src="assets/asset16.png">
                <p>3. This will open a file menu (usually to your recent files list where you’ll see any recent screenshots). Here, you can select the right screenshot. </p>
                <p>Be careful not to mistakenly select something which may identify you (but if you do, we will delete it from our records).</p>
                <p>If the interface doesn’t show your screenshot then you may need to navigate using the buttons at the top or side to your “Screenshots” folder (which is sometimes contained inside the “Pictures” folder).</p>
                <h3>Alternative step</h3>
                <p>If you are having trouble adding a screenshot – or you prefer not to add one – please use the next box (Question 9) to describe the scam communication. If you can cut-and-paste the message and add the phone number (if any) that would be very helpful.</p>

              <a class="question" href="#">What if I don’t receive any scam calls/messages each day?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>If you don’t receive any scam calls or messages on any particular day, we ask that you still go into the app and, on the opening page, select “<i>I am letting you know I have had no scam communication/messages today.</i>”</p>
                <p>This will let us know you didn’t get any scam messages, and that you’re still engaged in the study so we can pay you.</p>
                </div>
              
              <a class="question" href="#">How will I get paid my $80 for participating?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>After the completion of the study, you will be paid $80 in appreciation of your time and support.</p>
                <p>Just after the 14-day study is complete, we will send you a link to a secure form where you can provide your bank details. RMIT University will then process the payment, which should take a further 7-14 days.</p>
                <p>To make sure you’re eligible for payment, remember to submit the form every day, including the days in which you receive no scam communication, by clicking the “<i>I am letting you know I have had no scam communication/messages today</i>” button.</p>
              </div>

                <a class="question" href="#">I have other technical issues?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>If you are having any technical issues, please fill in the brief form <a href="contact.html">here</a> and one of the team will be in touch by SMS or email, usually within 24 hours.</p>
                  <p>You can also email us with any questions at <a href="mailto:scam.study.2024@gmail.com">scam.study.2024@gmail.com</a></p>
                  </div>

                <a class="question" href="#">What if I get scammed during the study?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>We hope no one will be scammed, but occasionally it does happen to the best of us.</p>
                  <p>If during the study (or at any time afterwards) you are concerned that you may have been scammed, we have some guidelines and advice for who to contact, attached <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/muvwo10815a1mrz2nuuk7/Scam-support-sheet.pdf?rlkey=ngqnmu8hiahpk2ltkjxsj8iun&dl=0">here</a>.
